# ssDNA-memory
Single-stranded, kilobase-scale DNA memory encoding scheme for archival in phage

You will need Python3.6 with the pycrypto and bitstring libraries installed to run the decryption algorithm.

Decode the file on the command line by typing:

python3.4 ssDNAMdecode.py filename
  
Filename is the name of the text file containing the sequence of DNA cloned to the phage. Three example text files are provided encoding lines from The Crucible, Waiting for Godot, and Hamlet.
